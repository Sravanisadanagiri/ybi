Title of Project: Women's Clothing Reviews Prediction with Multinomial Na誰ve Bayes

Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model using Multinomial Na誰ve Bayes to predict sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) in women's clothing reviews based on textual data. By analyzing customer sentiment, businesses can gain valuable insights into customer opinions and make data-driven decisions.

Data Source: The data for this project can be obtained from online retail websites or datasets available on platforms like Kaggle. It should include text reviews, associated ratings, and labels indicating sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, or neutral).

Import Library:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score
Import Data:

python
Copy code
# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv("women_clothing_reviews.csv")
Describe Data:

Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content. This includes examining data types, checking for missing values, and summarizing key statistics.
Data Visualization:

Create visualizations to gain insights into the data. For example, you can plot histograms of review ratings and word clouds of the reviews' text.
Data Preprocessing:

This step involves cleaning and preparing the text data. Common preprocessing steps include text normalization, tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatization.
Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X):

python
Copy code
# Define the target variable (y) and feature variables (X)
X = data['Review_Text']
y = data['Sentiment_Label']
Train Test Split:

python
Copy code
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Modeling:

python
Copy code
# Create a CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical format
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vectorized = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Build and train the Multinomial Na誰ve Bayes model
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train)
Model Evaluation:

python
Copy code
# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_vectorized)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
class_report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", conf_matrix)
print("Classification Report:\n", class_report)
Prediction:
You can now use the trained model to predict sentiment for new reviews by preprocessing the text data and using the model.predict() method.

Explanation:
In this section, provide a detailed explanation of the project's key components and steps. Discuss the importance of sentiment analysis for businesses, the choice of Multinomial Na誰ve Bayes as the classification algorithm, and how the model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Explain how the model can be used to make predictions on new data and its potential real-world applications.
